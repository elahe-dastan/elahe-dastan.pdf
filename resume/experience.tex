      I work with Golang services related to user management and authentication on the User vertical.
      We design a system for number masking works with multiple sides for ride and deploy it on virtual machines.
      Then we migrate our services to Kubernetes on-promise cloud using Helm charts and ArgoCD.
      We used ArgoCD application list to automatically generate argo application for our services and then
      we create GitOps pipeline for managing configuration and secrets in Git with their history available.
      I designed a system for automating the driver sigup process which reduce our registeration time and increased
      the number of registered drivers.

    {
      I first started by reviewing and re-desiging the current data pipline to improve its performace.
      I replaced old spark-based solution with Golang to handle 40K driver locations per second instead of
      8K per second. Upgrade cassandra cluster to hanlde new load and used Apache beam over Spark so we can
      have tests for our pipeline stages. Then I start working on our first ETA-predication service by gathering data
      from our new data pipeline, cleaning them and training models. I engineered features and detect the ones that can
      be useful and droped the useless features because we cannot use that huge data in memory for trainign our model.
      Then I shared the model so we can have smaller models that can be served on Kubernetes.
      After our first successful result, I owned the project and have meeting with the product team for desiging
      the project roadmap. I planned our first production release and did all pipeline by myself.
      One the cirtical steps for doing the production release is processing the huge amount of data and for that I
      start managing our ML server and create different environment with different quota for our data scients teams.

      During the time that I redesigning the pipeline, I mentored our interns on the pipeline stages, so we can maintain
      them after finishing the redesign without any problem.

      Also, I did interviews beside the development for hiring software engineers and data scientists.
