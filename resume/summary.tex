\begin{cvparagraph}
I studied computer engineering at Amirkabir university of tech from 2017 to 2022.
My thesis was on traffic prediction using deep learning under the supervision of
Dr.~Safabaksh. I tried to use both spatial and temporal features in my project and apply
convolution directly on the graph of routes in sepctral domain.
I started my career as a software engineer at Snapp Cab in 2020
and exprienced managing and deploying projects to production.
In 2021 I changed my team to map traffic and startd working as an ML engineer.
My focus has been on better estimating the time of arrival of a ride.
