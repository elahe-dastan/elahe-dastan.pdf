\section{Experience}

\cventry{2021 -- 2024}{Senior ML Engineer}{Snapp!}{Tehran, Iran}{}{
      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Built a recommendation system to recommend speed for streets that don't have sufficient data which \textbf{improved coverage from one million shard streets to 3 millions}.
            \item Initiated a project to give ETA (estimated time of arrival) in over 5 cities in both \textbf{Iran and Iraq} that overally \textbf{improved R2 by 20\%}.
            \item Teamed with 2 cloud engineers to develope a complete pipeline to train, version and deploy models using \textbf{Airflow, Spark, MLFlow, Katib, Feast, Tensorflow Server, FastAPI, Kafka Stream, Gitlab CI/CD} that \textbf{reduced train and deployment process time 70\%}.
            \item Developed a \textbf{Golang} microservice to benchmark the accuracy of different models real time, log metrics like \textbf{response time} using \textbf{Prometheus} and create dashboards on \textbf{Grafana} that speeded up QA by 80\%.
            \item Collaborated with product to clustered Iran cities from over 40 down to 10 which helped in reducing number of models.
            \item Implemented \textbf{HMM} algorithm to match GPS probes of drivers on streets and calculate speed of each driver afterwards.
            \item Trained and deployed models to predict the speed of street for future time buckets which \textbf{reduced ETA MAPE 5\%}.
            \item Owned a project to suggest the best pickup location to drivers and passengers that reduced offer-to-accept time 5\%.
            \item Participated in team's \httpslink[2022 3rd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)]{arxiv.org/abs/2309.09830}.
      \end{itemize}
      \textbf{Skills:} Collaborative filtering, Content-based filtering, Time-series forecasting, RNN, SARIMA, Tree-based models, Hierarchical clustering, Unsupervised learning

      \vspace{.4cm}
      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Integrated \textbf{vector database} solutions for efficient \textbf{similarity search} to return similar items in snapp shop which \textbf{increased conversion rate 5\%}.
            \item Fine tuned a pre-trained \textbf{OCR} model (\httpslink[EasyOCR]{github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR}) and deployed to read ID cards for a driver signup project. This implementation significantly \textbf{reduced the signup process time from days to hours}.
            \item Employed \textbf{ONNX} to \textbf{boost inference speed by 10\%} for a transformer model and separate training and deployment phases.
            \item Engineered a \textbf{sentiment analysis} service utilizing \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)} to analyze over 10,000 Tweets daily for real-time insights into public sentiment regarding the company.
            \item \textbf{Mentored over 5 new joiners}, launched a consistent mentorship program and a new interview pipeline.
