\section{Experience}

\cventry{2021 -- present}{Senior ML Engineer}{Snapp!}{Tehran, Iran}{}{
      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Conceptualized \textbf{matrix factorization} techniques like \textbf{ALS} to recommend speed for streets that don't have sufficient data which \textbf{improved coverage from one million shard streets to 3 millions}.
            \item Started a project to give ETA(estimated time of arrival) using ML models (\textbf{Random Forests} and \textbf{Fully Connected Neural Networks}) in over 5 cities in both Iran and Iraq that overally improved R2 by 20\%.
            \item Teamed with 2 cloud engineers to develope a complete pipeline to train, version and deploy models using \textbf{Airflow, Spark, MLFlow, Katib, Feast, Tensorflow Server} that reduced train and deployment process time 70\%.
            \item Load tested models using \textbf{K6}. The NN model's \textbf{p90 response time} was around \textbf{10ms} and Random Forest's was around \textbf{30ms}. Made sure of online benchmarking, monitoring, tracing.
            \item Collaborated with product to clustered Iran cities \textbf{Hierarchically} from over 40 down to 10 which helped in reducing number of models.
            \item Integrated \textbf{vector database} solutions for efficient \textbf{similarity search} to return similar items in snapp shop which \textbf{increased conversion rate 5\%}.
      \end{itemize}

      \vspace{.4cm}
      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Developed a \textbf{CRF}-based model for \textbf{NER} that assisted search engine to \textbf{increase succesful searches by 15\%}. 
            \item Implemented \textbf{Content-Based Filtering} for ride suggestions to passengers, resulting in \textbf{30\% reduction in app search time}.
            \item Fine tuned a pretrained \textbf{OCR} model (https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) and deployed to read ID cards for a driver signup project. This implementation significantly \textbf{reduced the signup process time from days to hours}.
            \item \textbf{Mentored over 5 new joiners}, launched a consistent mentorship program and a new interview pipeline.
            \item Employed \textbf{ONNX} to \textbf{boost inference speed by 10\%} for large language models.
            \item Participated in team's 2022 3rd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV).

      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Implemented \textbf{Kalman filtering} to \textbf{enhance the GPS positioning by 10\%}.
            \item Predicted where the person should be in a 30 minute time bucket using \textbf{time-series deep learning models} and alert otherwise.
            \item Employed \textbf{Tensorflow Lite} for models to \textbf{reduce memory usage by 50\%} to be able to run the model on mobile phones.
            \item Launched a \textbf{Kafka} pipeline to gather data from sensors using \textbf{Protobuf} and store into \textbf{DataLake} capable of handling \textbf{+20k messages per second}.
            \item Achieved an \textbf{0.8 F1} score in \textbf{event detection} by training a \textbf{recurrent neural network}.
      \end{itemize}
