\section{Summary}\closesection{}

I studied computer engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology from 2017 to 2022.
My thesis was on traffic prediction using deep learning.
I tried to use both spatial and temporal features in my project and apply
convolution directly on the graph of routes in spectral domain.
Then I pursue my academic carrier by getting Master in Artificial Intelligence.

I started my career as a machine learning engineer at Avidnet Technology in 2018 and experienced managing
and deploying projects to production.
I continue my carrier and started working as an ML engineer in Snapp which is the biggest ride healing company in Iran.
My focus has been on better estimating the time of arrival of a ride.
I've experienced all the stages of giving an ML solution from data gathering and preprocessing
till training and deploying the model to production.
I've also changed data pipeline to make it more maintainable, scalable and real time.
I have software engineering and ML experience at the same time and like to continue my journey in both of them.
