\section{Summary}\closesection{}

I studied computer engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology from 2017 to 2022.
My thesis was on traffic prediction using deep learning.
I tried to use both spatial and temporal features in my project and apply
convolution directly on the graph of routes in spectral domain.
Then I pursue my academic carrier by getting Master in Artificial Intelligence.

I started my career as a software engineer at Avidnet Technology in 2018 and experienced managing
and deploying projects to production. Back then I worked as full stack engineer and also because
of my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence I designed their algorithms and pipelines.
Then I continued my journey with Snapp as software engineer mainly focused on designing and implementing
high load HTTP endpoints. After while, because of my interest in Kubernetes, I switch to the Cloud platform
team that delivers applications useful for all teams.
