      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
      \item Directed the design of a scalable, microservice based architecture, harnessing the power of \httpslink[\textbf{NATS}]{nats.io} as the primary message-passing system, enabling seamless communication across \textbf{+125 clients} and achieving throughput of \textbf{+300k messages per second}.
      \item Set up \textbf{Machine learning pipelines} including \httpslink[\textbf{Airflow}]{airflow.apache.org} and
            \httpslink[\textbf{Seldon}]{www.seldon.io} which reduced ML models \textbf{response time} by \textbf{15\%}
            with help of batch request and \textbf{gRPC} protocol.
      \item Set up Kafka on Kubernetes using \httpslink[\textbf{Strimzi}]{strimzi.io} operator handling \textbf{over 300k messages per second across 50 topics},
            ensuring seamless data streaming and enabling real-time analytics for the organization.
      \item Configure NATS on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (\textbf{ROSA})
            using Helm charts to lower costs 10\% by deprecating Amazon Simple Queue Service (\textbf{SQS}).
      \item Developed over 10 machine learning models using \textbf{FastAPI}, resulting in a \textbf{40\% reduction in data processing time} and enabling the data team to deliver insights faster.
      \item Architected a \textbf{Rust}-powered Kubernetes operator to enforce policies on NATS CRDs, enhancing system stability and scalability; achieved a \textbf{30\% reduction in resource consumption} and enabled seamless integration with existing infrastructure.
      \item Collaborated with product and data teams to implement exactly once semantics using \textbf{kafka stream} from topic to topic for 2 services.
      \item \textbf{Mentored over 5 new joiners}, launched a consistent mentorship program and a new interview pipeline.

      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
            \item Optimized driver location collector (written in \textbf{PHP}) by migrating into a modern platform, re-written in \textbf{Go} and cloud infrastructure,
                  increasing availability by 20\% and facilitating faster rollout of new functionalities.
            \item Developed a \textbf{real-time stream processing} service to dynamically adjust pricing and balance demand and supply,
                  resulting in a 5\% increase in the number of accepted rides.
            \item Architected and maintained Golang services for \textbf{real time} order processing, implementing microservices for \textbf{geofencing} and geospatial indexing using \httpslink[\textbf{Tile38}]{tile38.com}; reached \textbf{sub-millisecond response times} and ensured high performance and reliability.
            \item Created \textbf{RESTFul} microservices for authentication, authorization and sign-up procedures that handles \textbf{+100k request per second}. All  deployed via Gitlab \textbf{CI/CD}.
            \item Programmed a system for driver and passenger number masking, coded in \textbf{Golang}
                  and deployed on virtual machines managed by \textbf{OpenNebula}. More than \textbf{35\%} of customers are using this feature.
            \item Implemented \textbf{ArgoCD} ApplicationSet to automatically generate ArgoCD Application for \textbf{10+ services}, \textbf{reducing deployment time by 50\%} and ensuring consistent configuration across environments.
            \item Designed a system for automating the driver sign up process which decreased driver registration time \textbf{from 2 hours to 15 minutes} and increased the number of registered drivers.
            \item Fine tuned a pre-trained \textbf{OCR model} to read data from the social ID cards drivers uploaded in drivers' sign up process. The model showed 92\% accuracy.
            \item Designed and optimized databases using \textbf{PostgreSQL} and \textbf{MongoDB} which reduced response time of 3 services by 30\%.

      \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
      \item Employed \textbf{Tensorflow Lite} for models to \textbf{reduce memory usage by 50\%} to be able to run the model on mobile phones.
      \item Launched a \textbf{Kafka} pipeline to gather data from sensors using \textbf{Protobuf} and store into \textbf{DataLake} capable of handling +20k messages per second.
      \item Achieved in-application video call solution using \textbf{WebRTC} based on \textbf{Pion} Framework which \textbf{increased application installation rate by 5\%} and can handle \textbf{1K concurrent calls} on out distributed design.
