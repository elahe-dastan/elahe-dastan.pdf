\textbf{Software Engineer,} Snapp! -- Tehran, Iran \hfill Feb 2023 -- present
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Directed the design of a scalable, microservice based architecture, harnessing the power of
            \href{https://nats.io}{\textbf{NATS}} as the primary message-passing system,
            enabling seamless communication across \textbf{+125 clients} and achieving throughput of \textbf{+300k messages per second}.
      \item Set up \textbf{Machine learning pipelines} including \href{https://airflow.apache.org}{\textbf{Airflow}} and
            \href{https://www.seldon.io}{\textbf{Seldon}} which reduced ML models \textbf{response time} by \textbf{15\%}
            with help of batch request and \textbf{gRPC} protocol.
      \item Set up Kafka on Kubernetes using \href{https://strimzi.io}{\textbf{Strimzi}} operator handling \textbf{over 300k messages per second across 50 topics},
            ensuring seamless data streaming and enabling real-time analytics for the organization.
      \item Configure NATS on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (\textbf{ROSA})
            using Helm charts to \textbf{lower costs 10\%} by deprecating Amazon Simple Queue Service (\textbf{SQS}).
      \item Developed over 10 machine learning models using \textbf{FastAPI}, resulting in a \textbf{40\% reduction in data processing time} and enabling the data team to deliver insights faster.
      \item Architected a \textbf{Rust}-powered Kubernetes operator to enforce policies on NATS CRDs, enhancing system stability and scalability; achieved a \textbf{30\% reduction in resource consumption} and enabled seamless integration with existing infrastructure.
      \item Collaborated with product and data teams to implement \textbf{exactly once semantics} using \textbf{kafka stream} from topic to topic for 2 services.
      \item \textbf{Mentored over 5 new joiners}, launched a consistent mentorship program and a new interview pipeline.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Python/Go Software Engineer} Snapp! -- Tehran, Iran \hfill Aug 2020 -- Feb 2023
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Optimized driver location collector (written in \textbf{PHP}) by migrating into a modern platform, re-written in \textbf{Go} and cloud infrastructure,
            \textbf{increasing availability by 20\%} and facilitating faster rollout of new functionalities.
      \item Developed a \textbf{real-time stream processing} service to dynamically adjust pricing and balance demand and supply,
            resulting in a \textbf{5\% increase in the number of accepted rides}.
      \item Architected and maintained Golang services for \textbf{real time} order processing, implementing microservices for \textbf{geofencing} and
            geospatial indexing using \href{https://tile38.com}{\textbf{Tile38}}; reached \textbf{sub-millisecond response times} and
            ensured high performance and reliability.
      \item Created \textbf{RESTFul} microservices for authentication, authorization and sign-up procedures that handles \textbf{+100k request per second}. All  deployed via Gitlab \textbf{CI/CD}.
      \item Programmed a system for driver and passenger number masking, coded in \textbf{Golang}
            and deployed on virtual machines managed by \textbf{OpenNebula}. More than \textbf{35\% of customers are using this feature}.
      \item Implemented \textbf{ArgoCD} ApplicationSet to automatically generate ArgoCD Application for \textbf{10+ services}, \textbf{reducing deployment time by 50\%} and ensuring consistent configuration across environments.
      \item Designed a system for automating driver sign up process with \textbf{Django} and \textbf{Celery} which decreased driver registration time \textbf{from 2 hours to 15 minutes} and increased the number of registered drivers.
      \item Fine tuned a pre-trained \textbf{OCR model} to read data from the social ID cards drivers uploaded in drivers' sign up process. The model showed \textbf{92\% accuracy}.
      \item Redesigned and sharded a \textbf{MongoDB} database for a chat service, effectively \textbf{halving the response time} and \textbf{extending the data retention period from 1 to 6 months}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineer AI/ML} Avidnet Technology -- Tehran, Iran \hfill Jan 2018 -- Aug 2020
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Employed \textbf{Tensorflow Lite} for models to \textbf{reduce memory usage by 50\%} to be able to run the model on mobile phones.
      \item Launched a \textbf{Kafka} pipeline to gather data from sensors using \textbf{Protobuf}
            and store into \textbf{DataLake} capable of handling \textbf{+20k messages per second}.
      \item Achieved in-application video call solution using \textbf{WebRTC} based on \textbf{Pion}
            Framework which \textbf{increased application installation rate by 5\%} and can
            handle \textbf{1K concurrent calls} on distributed design.
\end{itemize}
