\section{Employment}

\cventry{Feb 2023 -- present}{Platform Engineer}{Snapp!}{Tehran, Iran}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Led the design and implementation of a scalable, microservice-based architecture for a delivery industry application,
            using \httpslink[\textbf{NATS}]{nats.io} as the primary message-passing system for \textbf{+125 clients} and delivering
            \textbf{+300k messages per second}.
      \item Setup \textbf{Machine learning pipelines} including \httpslink[\textbf{Airflow}]{airflow.apache.org} and
            \httpslink[\textbf{Seldon}]{www.seldon.io} which reduced ML models \textbf{response time} by \textbf{15\%}
            with help of batch request and \textbf{gRPC} protocol.
      \item Set up Kafka on Kubernetes using \httpslink[\textbf{Strimzi}]{strimzi.io} operator and maintain it to manage +300k
            message per second, +50 topics.
      \item Deploy Airflow on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (\textbf{EC2}) instances and then use
            its Amazon Elastic Container Service (\textbf{ECS}) operator
            to run more than 100 jobs.
      \item Configure NATS on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (\textbf{ROSA})
            using its Helm chart to lower costs 10\% by deprecating Amazon Simple Queue Service (\textbf{SQS}).
      \item Setup security, access management and control solutions using \textbf{Teleport} for around 10 services.
      \item Used \textbf{FastAPI} to serve more than 10 models for the data team on cloud.
      \item Worked with \textbf{Rust} to implement concurrent, safe and performant Kubernetes operator for forcing
            policies over NATS CRDs including streams and consumers.
      \item Deploy \textbf{Cassandra} with 5 nodes on Virtual Machines to support teams that prefer availability over consistency.
      \item Implemented exactly once semantics using \textbf{kafka stream} from topic to topic for 2 services.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{Aug 2020 -- Feb 2023}{Software Engineer}{Snapp!}{Tehran, Iran}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Optimized driver location collector (written in \textbf{PHP}) by migrating it into a modern platform, re-written in \textbf{Go} and cloud infrastructure,
            increasing availability by 20\% and facilitating faster rollout of new functionalities.
      \item Developed a \textbf{real-time stream processing} service to dynamically adjust pricing and balance demand and supply,
            resulting in a 5\% increase in the number of accepted rides.
      \item Built and maintained services in \textbf{Golang} to ensure
            high \textbf{performance} and \textbf{reliability} for real-time order processing
            and engineered a suite of \textbf{microservices} to enable real-time \textbf{geofencing} and in-memory geospatial
            indexing using \httpslink[\textbf{Tile38}]{tile38.com} with \textbf{sub-millisecond} response times.
      \item Created \textbf{RESTFul} microservices for doing authentication, authorization and sign-up procedures which handles more 100k request per second.
      \item Re-write +2 Golang projects to follow best practices like \textbf{DDD} and \textbf{SOLID}.
      \item We programmed a system for driver and passenger number masking, coded it in \textbf{Golang}
            and deployed it on virtual machines managed by \textbf{OpenNebula}. More than \textbf{30\%} of customers are using this feature.
      \item Migrated +20 of our services to \textbf{Kubernetes} on-promise cloud using \textbf{Helm} charts \textbf{andArgoCD}.
      \item We utilize \httpslink[\textbf{ArgoCD}]{argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable} ApplicationSet to automatically generate ArgoCD Application
            for our services and then we create \textbf{GitOps} pipeline for managing configuration
            and secrets in Git with their history available.
      \item Designed a system for automating the driver sign up process which decreased driver registration time \textbf{from 2 hours to 15 minutes} and increased the number of registered drivers.
      \item Fine tuned and deployed a pre-trained \textbf{OCR model} to read data from the social ID cards drivers uploaded in our drivers' sign up process. The model showed 92\% accuracy.
      \item Designed and optimized databases using \textbf{PostgreSQL} and \textbf{MongoDB} which reduced response time of 3 services by 30\%.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{Jan 2018 -- Aug 2020}{Software Engineer}{Avidnet Technology}{Tehran, Iran}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Keep track of the places a person spends time on a regular basis and name them and predict where the person should be in a 30 minute time bucket and alert otherwise.
      \item Employed \textbf{Tensorflow Lite} for models to \textbf{reduce memory usage by 50\%} to be able to run the model on mobile phones.
      \item Setup a \textbf{Kafka} pipeline to gather data from sensors using \textbf{Protobuf} and
            then stores them into our \textbf{DataLake} (which is set up using \textbf{Postgres}) and can handle +20k messages per second.
      \item Draw the map of the house using accumulated GPS points
      \item Provide in-application video call solution using \textbf{WebRTC} based on \textbf{Pion} Framework which \textbf{increased application installation rate by 5\%} and can handle \textbf{1K concurrent calls} on out distributed design.
\end{itemize}
